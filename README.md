Task Forest: A Gamified Task Manager with Virtual Pet and Pomodoro Timer

Task Forest is a gamified task manager web application designed to make task management more engaging and productive. With Task Forest, users can manage their tasks while also owning a virtual pet that grows and evolves as they complete tasks. The application also includes a Pomodoro timer, a popular time-management technique that helps users stay focused and productive.

Task Forest is my honors project for Nucamp graduation, a task management web application that leverages Python and the Django web framework for the backend, HTML for the frontend, and CSS and JavaScript for styling and interactivity. In addition to the basic features of creating, marking, and deleting tasks, Task Forest also provides analytics to track the user's task completion progress.
