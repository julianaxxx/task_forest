Task Manager

Task Manager is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can create tasks, mark tasks as completed or in progress, and delete tasks. The application also includes an analytics about the user's tasks.

This is my honors project for Nucamp graduation, a task management web application with analytics features. The project uses Python and the Django web framework for the backend and HTML the frontend.
